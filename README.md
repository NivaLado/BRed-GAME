# BRed-GAME
 Little red riding hood game
 
 
I've created an immersive game with fully animated character movements, including walking, running, flying, and combat. Enemies intelligently chase the player using the A* search algorithm. The character can launch projectile attacks with dynamic particle effects. A realistic cloak, following physical laws, adds an extra layer of detail. Atmospheric fog enhances the visual experience using shaders.
